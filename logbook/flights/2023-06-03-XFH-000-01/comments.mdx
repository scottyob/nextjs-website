This was a very interesting flight.  My flight was two hours and 50 mintutes, but I never made my way across the valley.

I found it challenging to try and ensure that I had enough height to move away from the house thermals.

In the end, I made the decision as the day was pushing on, to try and head towards the granite rock, and hope I could catch a thermal up there, because I’d then be half the way to the turkey farm.  Unfortunately, I did not find any meaningful lift towards the granite rock, nor over last chance, and landed in the LZ.

Things I’m interested in, I did a lot of ridge soaring to get back up to launch area.  It felt perfectly safe, but definitely had less ground clearance than I’d usually like.
