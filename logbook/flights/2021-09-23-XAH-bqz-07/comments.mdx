6:30pm, great long flight.  Much like a previous trip flying cove where I could have benched back if I had the time.  Alex decided to head back as we were losing light, so this ended up being a good call.  Finished packing up at night fall.  Loved this flight, easy lift, amazing.  until the end, lift seemed more ridge lift
