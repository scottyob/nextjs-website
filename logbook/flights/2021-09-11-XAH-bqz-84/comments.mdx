2nd time flying.  Dave Oddy was sponsor.  Fantastic 50 minute flight, Dave mentioned that if we punch out and down a bit, the ridges near the horses trail \(trail switching back\) are good for some lift.  I found a tiny bit there before landing and managed to sustain my flight for a fair bit.  I'm fairly proud of this.  I feel I may have flown when others landed due to having more of a risk tollerance when ridge soaring.  This may be a dangerous thing though that I'll need to keep evaluating.
