> 2,000 feet per minute alti change! Went up for an afternoon flight.  This was some very, very punchy thermals that I didn't love, so decided to go out and land.  Made a call to do a 360 to loose some height in sink, that ended up being the wrong one, as there was tons of sink heading to the LZ.  Probably would not fly this in a hurry and would work up to this active air
