Great conditions, went above launch and the peak, decided not to head back.  Came down after I wasn't sure about height, oxygen or how bumpy it'd be.  This is the first time I've felt really comfortable in active air, where I was happy with the active piloting and little bumps and dives.  Just practice I guess.  Learned that to make cove club I need to be up behind the ridge.   Interesting moment was on my way down, being eye to eye with a sail plane after having passed them a few thousand feet above.
