2021-09-11,,SP (SW) Mission,3008,BDG EN-B,2021-09-11-XAH-bqz-84.igc,"2nd time flying.  Dave Oddy was sponsor.  Fantastic 50 minute flight, Dave mentioned that if we punch out and down a bit, the ridges near the horses trail (trail switching back) are good for some lift.  I found a tiny bit there before landing and managed to sustain my flight for a fair bit.  I'm fairly proud of this.  I feel I may have flown when others landed due to having more of a risk tollerance when ridge soaring.  This may be a dangerous thing though that I'll need to keep evaluating."

2021-09-16,,"Point of the Mtn, South",112,"BGD Winter, EN-B",2021-09-16-XAH-bqz-02.igc,First time flying point of the mountain.  What's interesting here is that I had plenty of height and probably could have pushed out the back.  Was talking to harry who mentioned he likes to push back if he has the height towards the end of the parking lot and move to the far side to make it easy to bail out and land if need be.  Would have liked to do this.  Short flight as I was losing light and wanted to wait for the wind to calm down a little bit.  There was an event where someone died this flight which put me on edge.  A speed wing pilot who was doing barrel rolls.

Looking at track log, I had some lift I flew right through that I could have worked more."

Much like a previous trip flying cove where I could have benched back if I had the time.  Alex decided to head back as we were losing light, so this ended up being a good call.  Finished packing up at night fall.  Loved this flight, easy lift, amazing.  until the end, lift seemed more ridge lift"

Got to ride up the ridge right up to 11,700 feet but got a little bit concerned with the strength at this point, so decided to push out and land in the LZ.  I had plenty of height on ground"
2021-09-23,,"SP (N, W, S) Cove_Richfield_Monroe",942,"BGD Winter, EN-B",2021-09-23-XAH-bqz-09.igc,"> 2,000 feet per minute alti change! Went up for an afternoon flight.  This was some very, very punchy thermals that I didn't love, so decided to go out and land.  Made a call to do a 360 to loose some height in sink, that ended up being the wrong one, as there was tons of sink heading to the LZ.  Probably would not fly this in a hurry and would work up to this active air"

Came down after I wasn't sure about height, oxygen or how bumpy it'd be.  This is the first time I've felt really comfortable in active air, where I was happy with the active piloting and little bumps and dives.  Just practice I guess.  Learned that to make cove club I need to be up behind the ridge.   Interesting moment was on my way down, being eye to eye with a sail plane after having passed them a few thousand feet above."
2021-09-25,,SP (W) Monroe Peak (Richfield),4227,"BGD Winter, EN-B",2021-09-25-XAH-bqz-11.igc,"WHAT A FLIGHT!  Made it from Monroe peak, to Cove mountain.  Had a bit of a low save off Monroe, not finding lift off the bat.  I couldn't seem to work Cove back up to the mountain and took a 40% colapse during flight, which made me want to land.  Looking at the track logs, I feel I may have left a thermal to go searching for stronger lift when I should have stuck with it more.  Fantastic flight"
