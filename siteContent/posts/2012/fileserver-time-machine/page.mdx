So lately I've been thinking about my backup strategy on my Mac. From previous posts you might know I've build my OpenIndiana ZFS FileServer. Well, just created a volume and decided to put 300GB to good use to create a time machine on my mac. There is a brilliant guide on how to do it [here](http://marcoschuh.de/wp/?p=494) and suggest you all take a look (Thanks for the awesome guide Marco).
