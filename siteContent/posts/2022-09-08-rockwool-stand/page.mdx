import { Gist } from 'gist-react';

Last time I did hydroponic growing and germinated seeds in the rockwool, I found it annoying that the roots would grow out the bottom of the rockwool, then get squished by the ground, making it harder to have dangling roots to easily transfer to an NFT system.

I used an [Openscad](https://openscad.org/) model to solve this :)
