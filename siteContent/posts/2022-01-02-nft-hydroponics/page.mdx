As my hydroponic experiemnt has shown success, I wanted to scale this up.  My plan is to build an NFT hydroponic system for the yard, and dutch bucket for tomatoes.

From my [light study](/post/2021-10-10-light-study/) I found the fence and some areas that may make some good light.

I found https://university.upstartfarmers.com/blog/sizing-a-pump-hydroponics-aquaponics that describes NFT Hydroponics is 4-6 GPH required for my pump.  I'm going to start with one trough, but plan on scaling this up to 3 if it works, so will require 18GPH of total flow.  7 feet of height is required if I want to mount this on the top of the fence.
