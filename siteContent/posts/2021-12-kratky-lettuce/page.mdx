This year i've decided to start playing with Hydroponics as a hobby.  I've been interested in starting with the [Kratky Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kratky_method) of gardening.  The idea is to grow lettuce in mason jars and see how growing without soil does.  I've previously enjoyed growing my own alfalfa micro-greens, so this is the next obvious step.

## Attempt #1
These didn't go so good.  I had planted some seedlings in Rockwool, and left them in a container out in the sun to act as a mini-greenhouse.  In the SF Bay area getting towards winter, I feel it may have been too cold, and most of my seedlings ended up dying off.  The mason jar didn't do so well once it was planted either.  ~6 weeks in I'd call my first attempt a failure.

## Attempt 2
- 22nd November:  Planted seeds in Rockwool
- ~29th November:  Started moving to a half-nutrient watering solution
- 5th December (+13 days):  Moved to mason jars

I decided to try and move indoors.  I got a [150 Watt LED bulb (5000K)](https://www.acehardware.com/departments/lighting-and-electrical/light-bulbs/led-bulbs/3933314) to provide the light, and turned my old proofing box to a simple 9 hour a day timer.  I find this is a good time of a year for indoor growing as the temperature with the grow light on is between 14c and 23c of a day.  The ideal temperature for growing is 13-18c, so I'm curious to see how they go indoors in the warmer climate.

I'm using [this guide](https://growguru.co.za/blogs/hydroponic/ph-ppm-ec-water-for-hydroponic-plants) for measuring the lettuce levels:
- **PH**: 5.5-6.5
- **EC**: 0.8-1.2

note:  Work in progress.  Will update once plants have had more of a chance to grow.
