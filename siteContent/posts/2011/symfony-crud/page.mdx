I've recently come up across some problems with the CRUD generator in Symfony, so in case anyone is googling for a solution out there, I'll try and help you along (or at least bump up the page references to the articles that helped me ðŸ˜‰ )

I had a problem today where I was trying to use Symfony's (1.4) generate-admin [CRUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete#User_interface) generator. The issue was that my titles were not sortable when adjusting the fields to display in the generator.yml file

```text
config:
 actions: ~
 fields: ~
 list:
 batch_actions: {}
 object_actions: {}
 display: [pin, **firstName**, **lastName**, location, institution]
 filter:
 display: [firstName, lastName]
 form: ~
 edit: {}
 new: {}
```

The issue with the firstName and lastName fields is that, if written like **first_name** and **last_name** it will fail to become sortable. I found a solution as to why in a [blog post](http://oldforum.symfony-project.org/index.php/t/22636/) from a man with the same issue (Symfony 1.2)

**Foreign keys not Sortable:**Another issue I had was where there is a foreign key in Symfony, the CRUD generator won't know how to make this sortable. I solved this by moving to [ahAdminGeneratorThemesPlugin](http://www.symfony-project.org/plugins/ahAdminGeneratorThemesPlugin) for the generate-admin modules.. Read the read-me in that guide and you'll be sweet! ðŸ™‚
