I want to write a quick and dirty blog post to tell you a little solution on downloading HTTP files in your off-peak usage using linux.

{/* --- */}

The tools I’ll be using for this is my old favourite [wget](http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) and a new tool, [“at”](http://linux.about.com/library/cmd/blcmdl1_at.htm).

The at daemon is required to be running first, so on debian or ubuntu

> /etc/init.d/atd start

Then downloading your file at an off-peak time (4am for me) is as simple as

> echo “wget –c [http://ubuntu.virginmedia.com/releases//maverick/ubuntu-10.10-desktop-i386.iso](http://ubuntu.virginmedia.com/releases//maverick/ubuntu-10.10-desktop-i386.iso)” | at 04:00

Simple hey 😄
