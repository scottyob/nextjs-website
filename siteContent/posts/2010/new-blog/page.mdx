Hello everyone. Ok, so this is a brand new blog. What happened to all my old content? I'd like to say I just wanted to start fresh, but truth is, I was lazy and didn't back up any data from my hosting company before my term ended with them.. so I lost my database and content. I'll re-post the good stuff, hopefully more in-depth on this site though. Stay tuned.

This blog is going to be a lot more personal then my last. It's going to have technical and personal posts where I'll post about anything and everything that takes my fancy. Good times ðŸ™‚
