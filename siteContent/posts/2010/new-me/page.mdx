More blogging to come. I saw a movie last night with Rebecca and one of her friends Kat. It was pretty good, we got to see [Mark Zuckerberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg)'s portrayal in [The Social Network](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1285016/)

It has made me realise a few things though. I mean, this guy is using open source tools to create some amazing things. I don't code half as much as I'd like to any more.. this is going to change. I have never used emacs before.. This is going to change. I need a new computer, that's pretty much it for now
