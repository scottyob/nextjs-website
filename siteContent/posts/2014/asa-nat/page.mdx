It's often handy when dealing with infringement notices and the like to have NAT translations logged.  Sure a better way would be to record netflow from these devices (and include the translations) but for a quick syslog solution, you can always enable by running the following...

{/* --- */}

```
logging enable
logging list ToSyslog level critical
logging list ToSyslog message 305011
```

See [http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/pix/pix63/system/message/63syslog/pixemsgs.html#wp1054604](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/pix/pix63/system/message/63syslog/pixemsgs.html#wp1054604)

Messages will look something like:

```
May 08 13:01:20 freewifi-asa.net.uow.edu.au %ASA-6-305011: Built dynamic TCP translation from inside:10.64.37.96/53008 to outside:192.131.251.2/49520
```
