At Meta, we have a few internal workflow orchestration engines.  The idea is to allow long-running jobs, or things that can be split into tasks and need to have safe "checkpoints" behind them be defined in a system that can safely execute them and make sure they're executed in a durable, reliable and scalable way.

As I stumble upon things that fit paradigms within Facebook externally, this page is to document them.

## Core-Workflow-Services, Task-Oriented tools

These typically have the concept of a "worker" program to define the flow of the workflow, and distributed "workers" to execute the steps.

## State machine driven approach

These differ from the above by having very fixed, simple states that we transition to.  Typically better to build a nicer UI, but less flexible unless creating complex states (sub-jobs, etc)
