When deciding what to attempt to grow where in the unit we're renting, I decided to perform a light study of the backyard.  To perform this, first I had used the [3D Scanner App](https://3dscannerapp.com/) to perform a LiDAR scan of the house.  Areas of interest are the fences and the walls of the house.  Once a scan is performed, I exported this to obj format, and loaded it into my favourite [Blender 3D](https://blender.org/)

Once I had the file in Blender, I used a light plugin to set my location, and keyframes to animate time of day, then I could alter the variables for month and day to see how much sun I'd get in various locations of the yard through the year.  I had also inserted some trees, using the current time of day and shadow location to work out roughly how high they were.

<ImageGallery items={
    [
        sun,
        animation
    ].map((img, i) => {return {original: img, thumbnail: img}})}
/>
