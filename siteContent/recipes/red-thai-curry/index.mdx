Simple red thai curry that was to die for.  I did my own veggies, added chicken, but, would do again.  This is a meal I could eat once a week.  This recipe is inspired from [Cookie + Kate's](https://cookieandkate.com/thai-red-curry-recipe/) recipe.

## Ingredients
* 1 Chicken Breast
* Olive Oil
* 1 Onion (chopped fine)
* Sprinkle of salt
* 1 thumb sized knob of fresh ginger, chopped finely
* 2 large garlic cloves, chopped finely
* 2 tbsp red thai curry paste (I like [Mae Ploy](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0044PYPVC/))
* 1 can coconut cream (or milk)
* beans, carrot, cauliflower.. Whatever veggies really
* 1 pinch of brown sugar
* 1 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 fresh lime
* basil and cilantro to garnish 

## Method
* Cube chicken breast, cook a bit for a few minutes (mine came up to 74c, so was safe to eat here)
* Remove chicken, put any juices aside
* Heat oil, put pan in medium hot, in goes the onion and sprinkle of salt.  Cook for 5 minutes or until soft 
* add ginger and garlic, stir continually for 30 seconds until fragrant.
* Add curry paste, cook and stir for two minutes.  Everything should turn into a mushy texture
* Add coconut milk, chicken juices (or a touch of water).  Stir to combine.
* Add veggies, bring to a boil, cover, then down to a simmer
* Leave cooking for 15 minutes or until veggies soft to your liking
* add soy sauce, and juice of lime (save two slices for garnish)
* Add some basil and cilantro in, cause why not.
* Plate over rice, garnish with basil and cilantro.
