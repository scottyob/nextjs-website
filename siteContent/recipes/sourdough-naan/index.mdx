## Ingredients
Wet:
* 1 cup of sourdough discard (~ 270g)
* 1/2 cup warm milk (~123g)
* 1/4 cup plain greek yogurt (~61g, I used honey vanilla, was yum)

Dry:
* 2 cups all purpose flour (~240g)
* pinch of salt (10g)
* 1tsp baking powder

## Method
* in a big bowl, mix wet ingredients
* add in dry ingredients
* Use a fork to really mix into a shaggy mess.  I like to scrape down the sides
* Let sit for ~3 hours
* Turn out and kneed on a flowered bench, cut into 8 pieces (half, half, half)
* Melt a generous (4tsp) butter in the microwave.  Add a few cloves of crushed garlic to it
* Heat skillet to a high heat, roll out cut bread with a rolling pin
* Place dough in pan, brush with garlic butter, flip
* Leave cooking for ~1 minute or so.  Just enough time to roll out your next one
* Place aside and cover to keep warm

## Notes
* Serves 8
