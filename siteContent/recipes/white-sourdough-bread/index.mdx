## Ingredients
* 350g of water
* 500g of bread flour
* 50g of sourdough starter, fed near it's peak
* 6-10g of salt

## Direction
1. Feed starter, have ready for 4pm
2. @ 4pm, place ingredients in a metal bowl, vigerously mix with fork until everything is somewhat combined.  Cover (I use plastic bag) and leave on counter
3. @ 5pm, The bread has gone through it's "autolyse" stage.  Start stretching and folding bread into the middle until it feels somewhat firm
4. Every hour or so until bed, keep stretching and folding.
5. At whenever bed time is, cover and leave over night.  In the summer, I leave by the window to try and avoid over-proofing
6. In the morning (early as possible if hot), turn out onto a kitchen counter.  Shape it, put it into a proofing basket, then pop it into the fridge for a few hours to a few days
7. Prepeat oven to 450f (230c), sprinke white rice flour over bread as a means to stop it to sticking to things, place into heavy pot with lid on to capture steam
8. Bake for 50 minutes with lid on
9. Further 5 minutes with lid off to brown top.
10. Remove from oven, let sit for an hour before carving

## Notes
I like to mix up some whole wheat flour in at times.  We've had good success up to 20% of the bread flour substituded for others
