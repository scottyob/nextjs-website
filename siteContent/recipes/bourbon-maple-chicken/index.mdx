## Ingredients
 - 8 chicken thighs
 - 4 tbsp olive oil
 - Juice of 2 lemons
 - 1 tbsp white wine vinegar
 - 1 tbsp crushed rosemary
 - 2 tbsp dried parsley flakes
 - 1 tbsp dried oregano leaves
 - 4 cloves garlic, minced
 - Salt & pepper
 - 2 cups bourbon (Makers Mark will do)
 - 1/2 cup maple syrup
 - 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar
 - 1/4 cup parsley

 ## Method
  - Mix together the olive oil, lemon juice, rosemary, parsley, oregano, and garlic.  Toss the chicken thighs in the marinade.  (If you plan ahead I recommend that you refrigerate the chicken for 8-24 hours.)
  - Preheat oven to 450 degrees.
  - Salt and pepper the chicken after removing it from the marinade.  Place chicken skin side down on a roasting pan and put it in the oven.
  - Flip chicken after 10 minutes.
  - Add bourbon, maple syrup, and apple cider vinegar to a skillet and bring to a low boil over medium high heat.
  - Remove chicken from the oven after another 20 minutes; or when the skin becomes crispy.
  - Once the bourbon sauce has reached a syrup like consistency stir in the parsley and add the chicken to the skillet skin side down.  Cook the chicken in the sauce for 2 minutes on each side; or longer if you want a richer taste.
