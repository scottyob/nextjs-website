## Baba Ganoush
## Ingredients
- One large eggplant (two medium would probably be fine)
- 2-4 cloves of garlic 
- 4 tbsp lemon juice
- optional: I bet lemon rind if you have fresh would go great.
- 4 tbsp olive oil
- 4 tbsp greek yoghurt (I used sour cream, was great)
- 3/4 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp cumin (or 1/2 curry powder and 1/2 cayenne)
- optional: pinch of smoked paprika to serve with a bit of oil.


## Method
- Cut eggplant in half, oil, place face down for 30-35 minutes at 475 (245c)
- place all other ingredients in food processor, run to get a smooth runny sauce
- scoop out eggplant meat, push through small strainer to remove moisture
- pace eggplant in foot processor, run to combine.

## Pizza
## Ingredients
- Whatever you have lying around really

I used:
- Baba Ganoush as sauce
- Brie sliced
- Feta sprinkled
- Potatoes sliced, boiled, lightly fried (note: would probably skip next time)
- large bunch of basil, rolled and sliced into strips
- handful of fresh mint
- Small tomatoes sliced
- to drizzle Reduced balsamic

## Method
- Place Baba Ganoush on bread base (I used old Lavish)
- Place ingredients on top, save some mint and basil for giving color at the end
- Bake around 450f for 10-25 minutes, depending on thickness of crust used.
