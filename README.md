This is my web site.

## Setting up

You'll need a google app to make API requests to my spreadsheet data

Your .env.local file should look something like the following:

```
project_id=website-387103
private_key_id=
private_key=
client_email=
client_id=
```

## TODO:
* Fix up flying comment formatting
* clean up logbook
* Rock climbing page
* get page x/y working
* taxonomy
* RSS feed
* Look to add a heatmap [like this](https://cal-heatmap.com/docs/showcase)
